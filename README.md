# NasaBtt

An exercise project in Elixir

*Congratulations! You have received a contract from NASA for a software application that will help to calculate the fuel required for the flight. This application aims to calculate fuel to launch from one planet of the solar system and land on another planet of the solar system, depending on the flight route.*


## Setting up

The easiest way to setup the correct version of Elixir and Erlang is to install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) and then to run `asdf install` to install the correct version of the languages.

In case of an immtable distro, use a container which shares your home folder, like [fedora toolbox](https://github.com/containers/toolbox).

## Running

The easier way to compile and run a few examples is to run `./start.sh` from within the root of the project, as this will compile the erlang project and run a few tests.

## Testing

To run standard tests and doctests, run `mix test`.
